// A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become .

// Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

function rotLeft(a, d) {
  let index = 0;
  let temp = a.slice(d % 3);
  let temp1 = a.slice(0, d % 3);

  return [...temp, ...temp1];
}

console.log(rotLeft([1, 2, 3], 200)); //[3,4,5,1,2]
// first [2,3,4,5,1]
